# InsightLab UX/UI Enhancements

## Overview

This document describes the interactive storytelling enhancements added to InsightLab, designed to create a compelling "wow effect" for recruiters evaluating Dominic Minischetti for data analyst or data storytelling roles.

## New Features

### 1. üß≠ Responsive Hero Layout
**What changed:** Re-centered the landing experience around a flexible toolbar and a dedicated metrics panel.

**User Experience:**
- Theme control sits beside the introduction for immediate context
- Desktop view uses a two-column grid that keeps the narrative and metrics balanced
- Mobile view turns the toolbar into thumb-friendly buttons stacked within the hero

**Technical Implementation:**
- New `.hero-header`, `.hero-layout`, and `.hero-aside` grid constructs
- Responsive CSS with flex-wrap and grid breakpoints at 62rem and 48rem
- Shared overlay styling for controls and metrics to maintain clarity across themes

### 2. üí° Personal Insight Cards
**What it does:** Humanizes the technical process with thought bubble overlays at key visualizations.

**User Experience:**
- 3 semi-transparent insight boxes positioned near charts
- Fade-in animations triggered by scroll
- Personal commentary on design decisions
- Examples:
  - "Built to visualize rent elasticity by borough"
  - "Bubble size represents transit access‚Äîrevealing 15-25% rent premium"
  - "This heatmap captures the pulse of NYC housing"

**Technical Implementation:**
- Module: `js/insightCards.js`
- Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
- Positioned strategically to avoid obstructing data
- Mobile-responsive (converts to inline cards)

### 3. üß† Data Transparency Layer
**What it does:** Keeps the "How I Built This" section fully expanded to spotlight technical depth without extra clicks.
